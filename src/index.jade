        h2 Contextual Inquiry
        h3.left-align A specialized form of field study where designers and project team members visit actual users in their workplace to analyze their work habits, activities, flows, and environmental factors.
      section
        h2 Surveys
        h3.left-align Users are asked a standard set of questions on paper, in person, by telephone, or by electronic mail.

      section
        h2 Focus groups
        h3.left-align Users participate in a facilitated discussion where they share their ideas and opinions about the system. Meet with groups until responses become repetitive

      section
        h2 Usability testing
        h3.left-align Users work with a computer prototype to perform given tasks. Evaluators and designers observe users’ performances and behaviors using the actual system to determine usability problems.

      section
        h2 Heuristic Evaluation
        h3.left-align A team of evaluators with HCI experience systematically apply a set of user-centered heuristics in order to evaluate the system. Multiple experts are recommended to increase the probability that they will identify the main problems.

            h3.left-align This is why buttons often look 3d, even a simple gradient in a submit button
          li
            h3.left-align Notice the grip zone in certain scroll basr & in the corners to invite people to grip and move

          li
            h3.left-align We often have to use something several times to learn it. It takes practice.

        h3.left-align
          strong Operant  conditioning:
        h3.left-align Positive outcome increases the probability that the behaviour will be successful
        h3.left-align
          strong Observational learning:

        ul
          li
            h3.left-align We should not be surprised when people use something for the first time, and it takes them a while to get used to it.
          li
            h3.left-align We just want to make sure this doesn’t take long

      section
        h2 Predictability
        ul
          li
            h3.left-align People should know what will happen before it happens
          li
            h3.left-align Previews are good while loading for instance
          li
            h3.left-align Use Labels / instructions  icons and images to set expectations:
            ol.small
              li
                .left-align What to do
              li

          li
            h3.left-align Provide info about where you are, what’s happening, what will happen in the future, has something finished?

            h3.left-align Feedback should not interrupt, it should complement.
          li
            h3.left-align People should know how to Undo a decision and correct a mistake
          li
            h3.left-align Example: a download load bar: how long it will take / you can cancel it.

        ul
          li
            h3.left-align Every action should have a reaction
          li
            h3.left-align Let people know that they have been heard / seen / felt
          li
            h3.left-align If you fail to acknowledge interaction, you will get unnecessary repetitions

      section
        h2 Indicate process and completion
        ul
          li
            h3.left-align
              strong Definite indicators:
              span  When the system knows exactly how long it will take for something to complete, such as: percentage / loading bars..
          li
            h3.left-align
              strong Indefinite indicator:
              span  When the system isn’t sure how long it will take for something to complete: Yes I am still working on this – ‘thank you please wait a moment’
